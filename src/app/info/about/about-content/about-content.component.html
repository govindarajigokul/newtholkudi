<h2>Introduction to Tholkudi Programme</h2>

<p>Tholkudi is a comprehensive digital archive and research repository dedicated to preserving and promoting the rich cultural heritage, languages, and traditions of Tamil Nadu's tribal communities. Our mission is to create a sustainable digital ecosystem that safeguards indigenous knowledge while making it accessible for research, education, and cultural preservation.</p>

<p>The project emerged from the urgent need to document and preserve the rapidly disappearing tribal languages, oral traditions, and cultural practices of Tamil Nadu's indigenous communities before they are lost forever.</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p>We are committed to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Preserving tribal languages, oral traditions, and cultural practices through comprehensive digital documentation</li>
  <li>Supporting community-led documentation initiatives and empowering tribal communities to tell their own stories</li>
  <li>Facilitating academic research on tribal communities while maintaining ethical standards and community consent</li>
  <li>Promoting cultural awareness and understanding between tribal and non-tribal communities</li>
  <li>Ensuring ethical access to indigenous knowledge while respecting community protocols and intellectual property rights</li>
  <li>Building capacity within tribal communities for cultural preservation and digital literacy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Community Partnership</h2>

<div class="community-section">
  <img src="assets/images/community-partnership.jpg" alt="Community Partnership" class="float-end ms-3 mb-3" style="max-width: 300px;">
  
  <p>Tholkudi operates in partnership with tribal communities across Tamil Nadu, ensuring that all documentation and preservation efforts are conducted with community consent and active participation. We believe in empowering communities to tell their own stories and maintain control over their cultural heritage.</p>

  <p>Our approach is based on the principle of <strong>community-controlled research</strong>, where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Communities determine what aspects of their culture should be documented</li>
    <li>Community members are trained as co-researchers and documentation specialists</li>
    <li>All materials are reviewed and approved by community elders before inclusion</li>
    <li>Communities retain ownership and control over their cultural materials</li>
    <li>Benefits from research and access are shared equitably with source communities</li>
  </ul>
